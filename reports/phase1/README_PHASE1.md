# PHASE 1: DATA PREPARATION AND CLEANING
## SQL Injection Detection - Learning Over Memorization

### COMPLETION DATE
2025-10-17

### OBJECTIVE
Prepare a high-quality, reproducible dataset of SQL queries (malicious & benign) that is clean, 
leakage-free, well-documented, balanced/understood, and split into stratified Train/Val/Test sets 
ready for model training.

### DURATION
Days 1-10

### FINAL DELIVERABLES

#### 1. Datasets (6 files)
- `cleaned_dataset.csv` - Initial cleaned dataset
- `cleaned_shuffled_no_contradictions.csv` - Shuffled, final clean
- `master_dataset_with_features.csv` - With 48 engineered features
- `train.csv` - Training set (149,026 samples, 70%)
- `validation.csv` - Validation set (31,934 samples, 15%)
- `test.csv` - Test set (31,935 samples, 15%)

#### 2. Documentation (8 files)
- `data_quality_report.json` - Initial quality assessment
- `data_cleaning_policy.json` - Normalization policies
- `contamination_leakage_report.json` - Leakage detection report
- `feature_descriptions.json` - Feature documentation
- `split_statistics.json` - Split metadata
- `class_weights.json` - Computed weights
- `removal_log.csv` - Removed rows log
- `phase1_completion_report.json` - Master report

- Malicious: 125,724 (59.05%)
- Ratio: 1.4423:1

**Feature Engineering:**
- Total features: 48
- Categories: Basic (7), Keywords (1), Boolean (23), Ratios (5), Advanced (3)

**Data Splits:**
- Train: 149,026 samples (70.00%)
- Validation: 31,934 samples (15.00%)
- Test: 31,935 samples (15.00%)
- Overlap: 0 queries
- Deviation: <0.001%

### KEY ACHIEVEMENTS

1. Dataset cleaned and validated
2. All data quality issues resolved
3. Sequential leakage detected and fixed
4. 48 engineered features created
5. SQL injection patterns documented
6. Perfect stratified split achieved
7. Zero data leakage confirmed
8. Comprehensive documentation created

### NEXT PHASE
